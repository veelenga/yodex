        "T-SQL data modification commands include MERGE for synchronizing tables, REPLACE for substituting data, and PURGE for clearing table contents.",
        "T-SQL supports INSERT for creating records, CHANGE for altering table structures, and EXTRACT for selective data removal."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Data modification commands are fundamental to database manipulation in T-SQL. INSERT adds new records to a table, UPDATE changes existing data based on specified conditions, and DELETE removes rows that match a given criteria. These commands are essential for maintaining and manipulating database contents while preserving data integrity and relationships."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "How do you perform a _conditional update_ in _T-SQL_?",
      "options": [
