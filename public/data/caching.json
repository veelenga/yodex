      "question": "Define _caching_ in the context of computer programming.",
      "options": [
        "Caching is a technique of storing frequently accessed data in a faster memory location to improve retrieval speed and reduce computational overhead, thereby enhancing overall system performance.",
        "Caching is a memory allocation strategy that dynamically redistributes system resources to prioritize critical processing tasks and minimize memory consumption.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Can you explain the concept of _cache hit_ and _cache miss_?",
      "options": [
        "Cache hits and misses are synchronization mechanisms that manage data consistency between distributed computing nodes and prevent concurrent access conflicts.",
        "A cache hit occurs when requested data is found in the cache memory, while a cache miss happens when the requested data is not present and must be retrieved from the primary memory or original data source.",
        "A cache hit represents a system failure where data integrity is compromised, and a cache miss indicates successful data verification and validation procedures.",
        "Cache hits indicate complete data transfer between memory segments, while cache misses signal the initiation of a data migration or replication process."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Cache hits and misses are fundamental metrics in understanding caching performance. A cache hit represents an efficient data retrieval where information is quickly accessed from the faster cache memory, reducing latency. Conversely, a cache miss requires fetching data from slower primary memory or the original source, which inherently involves more time and computational resources. These concepts help evaluate and optimize caching strategies across various computing systems."

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Cache performance is a nuanced balance between memory allocation and retrieval efficiency. While larger caches can improve hit rates by storing more frequently accessed data, they also consume more resources and introduce management complexity. The optimal cache size depends on specific workload characteristics, access patterns, and available system resources."
    },

      "options": [
        "Local caching and distributed caching are identical approaches that provide the same performance characteristics across all computing environments.",

        "Distributed caching is a legacy technique that has been completely replaced by local caching in modern application architectures."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The primary difference between local and distributed caching lies in data scope and communication mechanisms. Local caching is limited to a single application instance and offers low-latency access, while distributed caching enables data sharing across multiple nodes, introducing network overhead but providing greater scalability and data consistency across complex systems."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Explain the concept of _cache eviction_ and mention common strategies.",

        "A cache key is a temporary placeholder that represents the potential storage location for data, but does not directly link to specific cached content.",
        "A cache key is a unique identifier used to store and retrieve specific data in a cache, allowing rapid O(1) access to cached resources by providing a direct mapping between the key and its associated data."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Cache keys are fundamental to caching architectures, providing an efficient method of data retrieval. They serve as unique identifiers that enable quick lookup and storage of cached items, typically implemented through hash tables or similar data structures that allow constant-time access."

      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Cache invalidation is critical for maintaining data accuracy in caching systems. When source data changes, the cached version must be updated or removed to prevent serving incorrect information. This process helps maintain data integrity, prevents performance issues, and ensures that applications work with the most recent and accurate data available."
