      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Load balancers monitor server health through periodic checks, removing unresponsive servers from the server pool. This ensures high availability and fault tolerance by automatically redirecting traffic to functioning servers. Health checks typically involve sending periodic ping requests or checking specific application endpoints to verify server responsiveness."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "How does a _load balancer_ distribute traffic in a _stateless_ vs _stateful_ scenario?",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The key difference between stateless and stateful load balancing is how client connections are managed. Stateless load balancing treats each request independently, allowing flexible distribution across servers, while stateful load balancing ensures a single client remains connected to the same server throughout their session."

        "Session persistence prevents any server-side communication, isolating each server to improve overall system security and performance."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Session persistence is crucial for applications requiring consistent user experiences that depend on maintaining session state. By directing a client's requests to the same server, it preserves context-specific data and prevents potential inconsistencies that could arise from distributing requests across multiple servers."
