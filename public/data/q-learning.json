      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Q-Learning is fundamentally a reinforcement learning method where an agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards, and updating its understanding of which actions are most valuable in different states. The algorithm uses a Q-table or Q-function to estimate action values, allowing the agent to progressively improve its decision-making strategy through trial and error."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How does _Q-learning_ differ from other types of _reinforcement learning_ such as _policy gradient methods_?",
      "options": [
        "Q-Learning employs direct policy optimization through stochastic gradient descent, while policy gradient methods use value estimation techniques to iteratively refine action selection strategies.",
        "Q-Learning differs from policy gradient methods by using value-based learning that estimates action values, whereas policy gradient methods directly optimize the policy function by learning a probability distribution over actions.",
        "Q-Learning calculates global reward expectations through deterministic modeling, in contrast to policy gradient methods that use probabilistic action selection with continuous state representations.",

Q-Learning focuses on estimating action values indirectly, allowing the agent to choose actions based on accumulated reward expectations. Policy gradient methods, conversely, directly parameterize and optimize the policy function, creating a more direct but potentially less stable learning mechanism."
