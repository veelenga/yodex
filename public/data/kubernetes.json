      "options": [
        "Kubernetes serves as a cloud-native monitoring tool that tracks container performance and resource utilization, primarily designed for enterprise logging and analytics infrastructure.",
        "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts, providing advanced features like service discovery, load balancing, and self-healing.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Describe the roles of _master_ and _worker nodes_ in the _Kubernetes_ architecture.",
      "options": [
        "Kubernetes nodes are segregated based on their hardware specifications, with specialized nodes dedicated to specific types of computational tasks and management functions.",

        "Master nodes in Kubernetes primarily function as high-performance computing resources that run application workloads, while worker nodes handle cluster configuration.",
        "Kubernetes architecture consists of identical nodes that dynamically share all cluster responsibilities, with no distinction between management and execution roles."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The separation between master and worker nodes ensures clear responsibilities and enhances cluster reliability. Master nodes provide centralized control and decision-making, while worker nodes focus on running actual containers, creating a robust and scalable distributed system architecture."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How do _Pods_ facilitate the management of _containers_ in _Kubernetes_?",
      "options": [
        "Pods in Kubernetes represent the smallest deployable unit, allowing multiple closely related containers to share network namespace, storage volumes, and operate as a single logical unit with shared resources and communication.",
        "Pods are lightweight virtual machines that encapsulate entire application environments, providing complete isolation between different containerized components.",
        "Pods function as standalone container management interfaces that enable direct scheduling and resource allocation for individual microservices.",

        "Kubernetes Services operate through two core types: DirectConnect (for local pod communication) and GlobalRoute (for cross-cluster networking), enabling flexible traffic management."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Services in Kubernetes abstract the underlying network complexity by providing a stable IP and DNS name for accessing a set of pods. They enable dynamic load balancing, service discovery, and consistent network communication regardless of pod lifecycle or scaling changes."

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "ReplicaSets are core Kubernetes controllers that maintain a stable set of replica pods running at any given time. They work by continuously comparing the current state of pods with the desired state, automatically creating or terminating pods to ensure the specified number of replicas are always available. This self-healing mechanism prevents disruptions in application workloads by replacing failed or deleted pods without manual intervention."

        "Labels are performance metrics collected by the control plane, and selectors aggregate these metrics to optimize resource allocation and workload distribution."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Labels and selectors form a powerful mechanism in Kubernetes for logical resource organization and management. Labels are flexible, user-defined metadata attached to objects like pods, services, and deployments. Selectors allow administrators and applications to filter and group these resources based on their labels, enabling sophisticated, dynamic resource management without hardcoding specific resource references."

        "A rolling update in Kubernetes instantly replaces all pods simultaneously, which maximizes deployment speed and minimizes potential service interruptions during the update process.",
        "A rolling update in Kubernetes freezes all existing pods and creates an entirely new replica set before switching traffic, ensuring complete isolation during the deployment process."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Rolling updates are a critical deployment strategy in Kubernetes that allows gradual pod replacement without service interruption. The process involves creating new pods with updated configurations while maintaining the desired number of running instances, using health checks to ensure smooth transition and minimal risk to application availability."

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Service routing in Kubernetes is a powerful abstraction that decouples network connectivity from pod implementation. By using label selectors, Services can dynamically discover and route traffic to pods, enabling flexible and scalable application networking without requiring direct IP management."

      "id": 13,
      "question": "Explain _Kubernetes DNS_ resolution for _services_.",
      "options": [
        "Kubernetes implements a distributed DNS architecture where each node maintains its own independent name resolution system, preventing centralized service discovery.",
        "The Kubernetes DNS system uses traditional DNS servers from cloud providers, relying on external resolution mechanisms for internal cluster communication.",
        "Kubernetes uses CoreDNS as its default DNS service, providing automatic and scalable service discovery within the cluster through domain name resolution for services and pods.",
        "Kubernetes employs a custom DNS resolver that manually maps IP addresses to service names, requiring administrators to configure each network connection individually."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "CoreDNS is the standard DNS service in Kubernetes, automatically creating DNS records for services and pods. It enables automatic service discovery by translating service names to their corresponding cluster IP addresses. The DNS service runs as a deployment in the kube-system namespace and supports dynamic updates as services are created or destroyed, making cluster networking more flexible and easier to manage."

      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "CNI provides a pluggable interface for configuring network connectivity in container runtime environments. It allows different network providers like Calico, Flannel, and Weave to implement their own networking solutions while maintaining a consistent integration method with Kubernetes. The interface handles critical tasks such as allocating IP addresses, setting up network namespaces, and managing container network connections."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "How do you implement _Network Policies_, and what are their benefits?",
      "options": [
        "Kubernetes Network Policies represent a centralized traffic management system that routes all cluster communications through a single, predefined network gateway.",

        "Kubernetes Network Policies are configuration rules that control traffic flow between pods, enabling granular network segmentation and security within a cluster based on labels and selectors.",
        "Network Policies are dynamic routing mechanisms that automatically redistribute network traffic based on real-time cluster performance metrics."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Network Policies provide a powerful method for controlling network access in Kubernetes clusters. They operate at the pod level, allowing administrators to define precise ingress and egress rules using label selectors.
