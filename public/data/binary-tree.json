      "question": "What is a _Tree Data Structure_?",
      "options": [
        "A tree data structure is a memory allocation mechanism that dynamically organizes computational resources, with nodes representing memory blocks and their connections indicating data flow and dependencies.",
        "A tree data structure is a graph-like representation where nodes can have multiple connections without any specific hierarchical constraints, allowing for complex and non-deterministic relationships.",

        "A tree data structure is a hierarchical collection of nodes organized in a parent-child relationship, typically starting with a root node and branching out to represent complex data relationships and hierarchies."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Trees are fundamental data structures that represent hierarchical relationships. Unlike linear data structures like arrays or linked lists, trees allow for more complex connections between elements. They are crucial in computer science for representing organizational structures, file systems, decision trees, and efficient searching and sorting algorithms."

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Binary trees are versatile data structures fundamental to many algorithms and data manipulations. They provide a way to organize data with clear parent-child relationships, allowing for efficient traversal, searching, and hierarchical representation. The key distinguishing feature is the limit of two children per node, which enables various specialized implementations like binary search trees."
