    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Explain the main idea behind _Java_ and the concept of _Write Once, Run Anywhere_.",
      "options": [
        "Java can only run on Windows operating systems",
        "Java requires recompiling code for each different platform",
        "Java is a low-level language primarily used for system programming",
        "Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language designed to enable developers to write code that can run on any device or operating system through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Java achieves platform independence by compiling source code into bytecode, which can be executed by the JVM on any system. The JVM acts as an intermediary layer, translating bytecode into machine-specific instructions. This approach eliminates the need for recompilation across different platforms, making Java truly portable. The compilation process transforms Java source code (.java files) into bytecode (.class files) that can run on any device with a compatible JVM."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What are the _main features_ of _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Java's main features include platform independence, object-oriented programming, strong typing, automatic memory management, and robust security mechanisms.",
        "Java is a procedural language with limited object-oriented support",
        "Java does not provide any built-in security features",
        "Java has weak type checking and allows unrestricted memory access"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Java's features make it a powerful and flexible programming language. Platform independence is achieved through the JVM, while object-oriented principles allow for modular and reusable code. Strong typing helps catch type-related errors during compilation, and automatic memory management (garbage collection) reduces memory management complexity. Security features like the bytecode verifier and security manager help protect against malicious code execution. These characteristics make Java suitable for a wide range of applications, from web services to enterprise software."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Can you list some _non-object-oriented_ features of _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Java is purely functional and does not support any object-oriented concepts",
        "Java supports non-object-oriented features like primitive data types and static methods, which provide performance optimization and utility functions that don't require object instantiation.",
        "Static methods can only be used in utility classes",
        "Primitive data types in Java are treated exactly like objects"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "While Java is fundamentally object-oriented, it incorporates elements from other programming paradigms. Primitive data types like int, boolean, and char are stored directly in memory, offering better performance than their object counterparts. Static methods and variables belong to the class itself, allowing them to be called without creating an object instance. This flexibility enables more efficient and straightforward implementation of utility functions and shared resources."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Can you explain the difference between an _int_ and an _Integer_ in _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Int is only used for floating-point numbers, while Integer is for whole numbers",
        "Integer is just a more complex version of int that can store larger numbers",
        "Int and Integer are exactly the same type in Java with no differences",
        "An int is a primitive data type representing whole numbers, while Integer is a wrapper class that allows int to be used as an object with additional methods."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The int primitive is a basic number type stored directly in memory, providing efficient performance for numerical operations. The Integer wrapper class encapsulates the int primitive, offering object-oriented capabilities like null handling, conversion methods, and compatibility with generics. This allows int values to be used in collections and other object-based contexts. A typical use case demonstrates the difference: collections like ArrayList require object types, so Integer must be used instead of int."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What are _wrapper classes_ in _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Wrapper classes are a way to slow down Java program performance",
        "Wrapper classes are used only for mathematical calculations in Java",
        "Wrapper classes in Java are object representations of primitive data types, allowing primitives to be used in object-oriented contexts and providing additional utility methods.",
        "Wrapper classes completely replace primitive data types"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Wrapper classes bridge the gap between primitive types and object-oriented programming by converting primitives into full-fledged objects. They enable primitives to be used in generic collections, support null values, and provide helpful conversion and utility methods. A common example illustrates their use in collections and type conversion:\n\njava\nInteger num = 42; // Autoboxing\nList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();\nnumbers.add(num); // Requires object type\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What does it mean that _Java_ is a _statically typed_ language?",
      "options": [
        "Static typing is a method of memory allocation in Java",
        "Static typing in Java means variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile-time, ensuring type safety and allowing early detection of type-related errors.",
        "Static typing only applies to class variables, not local variables",
        "Static typing means variables cannot change their value after declaration"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Java's static typing provides compile-time type checking, which helps prevent type-related errors before the program runs. This approach ensures that variables are used consistently and correctly throughout the code, with types determined before execution. It allows for early error detection and enables compiler optimizations. A simple example shows how static typing works:\n\njava\nint count = 5; // Type explicitly declared\ncount = \"hello\"; // Compile-time error\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Is _Java_ a pure _object-oriented language_? Why or why not?",
      "options": [
        "Primitive types in Java are considered objects internally.",
        "Java only supports object-oriented programming and no other paradigms.",
        "Java is a pure object-oriented language with no non-object elements.",
        "Java is not a pure object-oriented language because it contains primitive data types and static methods, which are not part of objects."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "While Java strongly supports object-oriented programming, it retains some procedural programming characteristics. Primitive types like int, char, and boolean are not objects, and static methods can be called without creating an object instance. Pure object-oriented languages require all elements to be objects. Java provides wrapper classes for primitives to allow object-like interactions, but this doesn't make them true objects.\n\nExample of non-object elements:\njava\npublic class Example {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Static method call without object\n        int number = Math.max(5, 10);\n        \n        // Primitive type, not an object\n        int x = 5;\n    }\n}"
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What is _bytecode_ in the context of _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Bytecode is the raw machine code directly executed by computer hardware.",
        "Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent representation of Java code compiled from source code, which can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on any compatible system.",
        "Bytecode is a proprietary file format used only by Java compilers.",
        "Bytecode is the same as source code written in Java."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Bytecode serves as a critical intermediate step in Java's compilation process, enabling platform independence. When a Java program is compiled, source code is transformed into bytecode, a low-level, highly optimized set of instructions that can be interpreted by any JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system. This approach allows Java's famous 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' principle.\n\nExample of compilation process:\njava\n// Source Code (.java)\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Compiled to Bytecode (.class)\n// Executable by JVM on any platform"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "How does _garbage collection_ work in _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Garbage collection in Java is an automatic memory management process where the JVM automatically identifies and removes objects that are no longer reachable or in use by the program.",
        "Garbage collection completely prevents memory leaks in Java programs.",
        "Garbage collection manually requires developers to delete unused objects.",
        "Garbage collection immediately removes all unused objects as soon as they are created."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Java's garbage collection automatically handles memory management, reducing the risk of memory leaks and manual memory allocation errors. The process works by tracking object references and periodically identifying objects that are no longer accessible from the program's root set. While highly effective, garbage collection is not instantaneous and can introduce slight performance overhead.\n\nExample of object reachability:\njava\npublic class GarbageCollectionDemo {\n    public void demonstrateReachability() {\n        // Object becomes eligible for garbage collection\n        String temp = new String(\"Temporary\");\n        temp = null; // No longer reachable\n    }\n}"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What is the purpose of the _'final'_ keyword?",
      "options": [
        "A method to define constant mathematical values",
        "A special access modifier for private class members",
        "A keyword used only for creating static methods",
        "The 'final' keyword in Java restricts modifications by making classes unextendable, methods non-overridable, and variables immutable."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The final keyword provides immutability and prevents unexpected modifications in Java. When applied to a class, it prevents inheritance; to a method, it prevents overriding; and to a variable, it creates a constant value. This helps in creating more secure and predictable code by restricting runtime changes."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Can we _overload_ or _override_ _static methods_ in _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "Only non-static methods can be overloaded",
        "Static methods can be freely overridden in subclasses",
        "Static methods cannot be overridden, but they can be overloaded in Java, as overloading depends on method signature, not method type.",
        "Static methods cannot be overloaded or overridden"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Static methods belong to the class, not instances, so they cannot be overridden in the traditional sense. However, you can define multiple static methods with the same name but different parameters, which is method overloading. If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a parent class, it hides the parent method, rather than truly overriding it."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is the significance of _'this'_ keyword in _Java_?",
      "options": [
        "'this' is a special method for constructor chaining",
        "The 'this' keyword references the current object instance, helping to distinguish between instance variables and local variables with the same name.",
        "'this' is a keyword for importing external classes",
        "'this' is used to create new object instances"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'this' keyword is a reference to the current object within an instance method or constructor. It's particularly useful when method parameters have the same name as instance variables, allowing explicit differentiation between them. It can also be used to call other constructors, pass the current object as a parameter, or return the current object instance."
