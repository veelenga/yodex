    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Explain _Mutability_ and _Immutability_ in the context of _Strings_.",
      "options": [
        "Mutability describes the character encoding of strings, determining how characters are represented and stored in different programming memory architectures.",
        "Mutability in strings refers to whether a string object can be modified after creation, with immutable strings preventing direct changes and requiring the creation of a new string for any modification.",
        "String mutability is a concept that defines how strings can be compressed or expanded dynamically within memory allocation systems.",
        "Mutability represents the ability of strings to be converted between different data types without losing original character information."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strings can be implemented differently across programming languages. In immutable implementations like Python and Java, any string modification creates a new string object, while mutable approaches allow direct changes to the existing string. The key distinction lies in how memory and character sequences are managed during string operations."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "How do different _programming languages_ implement and manipulate _Strings_?",
      "options": [
        "String implementations vary based on the compiler's memory management techniques and the underlying hardware architecture's byte ordering.",
        "Programming languages handle string implementations primarily through universal encoding standards that ensure consistent character representation across different systems.",
        "Different programming languages implement strings uniquely, ranging from low-level character array representations in C to high-level object-oriented string classes in modern languages like Java and Python.",
        "Language-specific string implementations are determined by the programming paradigm, with functional languages using more abstract string processing methods."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "String implementation varies significantly across programming languages due to historical development, design philosophies, and specific language requirements. Factors like memory management, character encoding, and language paradigms influence how strings are created, stored, and manipulated."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Why are _Character arrays_ preferred over _Strings_ for passwords?",
      "options": [
        "Character arrays are preferred over strings for passwords because they can be explicitly cleared from memory, reducing the risk of sensitive data remaining in memory after use.",
        "Character arrays provide better performance for password storage by enabling more efficient memory allocation and retrieval mechanisms.",
        "Character arrays offer superior security through advanced memory partitioning techniques that isolate sensitive data from system access.",
        "Password storage in character arrays allows for more complex encryption techniques directly implemented at the memory level."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Security in password storage is critical, and character arrays provide an advantage by allowing direct memory manipulation. Unlike immutable strings, which persist in memory, character arrays can be explicitly overwritten, minimizing the window of potential data exposure and making forensic recovery more difficult."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Discuss how indexing works in _Strings_ and how it affects various operations.",
      "options": [
        "String indexing is a method of encoding text data using numerical representations that map characters to specific memory locations. Each character receives a unique identifier based on its position and type.",
        "String indexing assigns unique numerical labels to characters in a string, starting from 0 in positive indexing and -1 in negative indexing. This system allows efficient character access and manipulation in most programming languages.",
        "String indexing is a mechanism for tracking character positions through a dynamic mapping system that allocates numerical references based on string length and character complexity.",
        "String indexing represents a computational technique for organizing text data by creating hierarchical reference points within character sequences. It enables advanced text processing algorithms."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Indexing provides a systematic way to access individual characters within a string. Positive indexing starts from the beginning (0), while negative indexing allows reverse access, with -1 representing the last character. This approach enables precise character retrieval and manipulation across different programming environments."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What are _Pascal Strings_?",
      "options": [
        "Pascal Strings are a string representation method that stores the string's length explicitly as a prefix, typically in one byte, allowing direct length access without scanning for terminators. This approach provides memory efficiency and rapid length determination.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Developed in the Pascal programming language, this string representation stores length information directly before the string content. By prefixing the length, Pascal Strings eliminate the need for null-terminator scanning, providing more direct and potentially more efficient string handling compared to traditional null-terminated strings."

        "String concatenation represents a computational method for generating new string representations through advanced character sequencing and dynamic memory allocation strategies.",
        "String concatenation merges multiple strings into a single string, with time complexity typically O(n), where n represents the total length of the resulting string. Different languages implement various optimization strategies for efficient concatenation.",
        "String concatenation is a complex memory allocation process that dynamically reorganizes character sequences using specialized algorithmic transformations and memory mapping techniques."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The concatenation process involves combining strings, which can be computationally expensive, especially with multiple operations. Languages implement different strategies like string builders or immutable string handling to optimize performance and memory usage during concatenation."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Describe the _Time Complexity_ of substring search in _Strings_.",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Time complexity for substring search varies based on the specific algorithm used. Naive approaches have O(n * m) complexity, while advanced algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt reduce this to near-linear time by using preprocessing and pattern-specific optimizations. The efficiency depends on pattern structure, text length, and the matching strategy employed."
