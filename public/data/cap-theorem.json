    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is _CAP Theorem_ and why it's important for _distributed systems_?",
      "options": [
        "The CAP Theorem demonstrates that distributed systems can maintain full consistency and availability by implementing complex multi-node synchronization protocols.",
        "The CAP Theorem states that in a distributed system, it's impossible to simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. A system can only provide two of these three attributes at any given time.",
        "The CAP Theorem describes how distributed systems can perfectly balance all three attributes through advanced architectural design and sophisticated middleware solutions.",
        "CAP Theorem is a theoretical framework that suggests distributed systems must always prioritize network performance over data integrity and system responsiveness."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Developed by Eric Brewer in 2000, the CAP Theorem highlights the fundamental trade-offs in distributed system design. When a network partition occurs, system architects must choose between maintaining data consistency or ensuring system availability, as it's technically impossible to guarantee all three attributes simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "How does the _CAP Theorem_ define _consistency_ in the context of a _distributed system_?",
      "options": [
        "Consistency represents the system's ability to maintain identical data representations across different computational layers and network segments.",

        "Distributed system consistency is achieved by implementing strict data replication mechanisms that synchronize information at predetermined time intervals.",
        "In the context of distributed systems, consistency means that all nodes in the system reflect the most recent write, ensuring that every read operation returns the most up-to-date data across all system components."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Consistency is a critical concept in distributed computing that ensures data uniformity across multiple nodes. It guarantees that when data is written to one part of the system, all other parts will reflect that change immediately, preventing data divergence and maintaining a single source of truth."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What does _availability_ mean in _CAP Theorem_?",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Partition tolerance is a fundamental concept in distributed systems that addresses network reliability. When communication between nodes is disrupted, a partition-tolerant system can continue functioning, which is critical in environments with unpredictable network conditions. This characteristic ensures system resilience by preventing complete system failure during network complications."
    },

When network issues occur, these systems would rather temporarily restrict access than risk returning potentially incorrect or conflicting data. This approach is crucial in scenarios like financial transactions or medical records where data precision is paramount."
