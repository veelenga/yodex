    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is _UX design_ and what are its key components?",
      "options": [
        "UX Design is a marketing strategy that uses user feedback to create promotional materials and improve brand positioning across digital platforms.",
        "UX Design is a systematic approach to data visualization that transforms complex user interactions into graphical representations for analysis.",
        "UX Design is a technical process of coding user interfaces that prioritizes visual aesthetics and computational efficiency in digital product development.",
        "UX Design is a user-centered approach to product development that focuses on creating meaningful and relevant experiences by understanding user needs, behaviors, and interactions with a product or service."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "UX Design goes beyond surface-level interactions by deeply understanding user needs, emotions, and motivations. It integrates multiple disciplines including user research, interaction design, information architecture, and usability testing to create intuitive and satisfying user experiences that meet both user expectations and business goals."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Can you explain the difference between _UX_ and _UI design_?",
      "options": [
        "UX design focuses on the overall user experience and journey, considering user needs, emotions, and interactions, while UI design specifically deals with the visual and interactive elements of a product's interface.",
        "UX design is primarily concerned with graphic design elements, whereas UI design manages backend technical implementations and system architectures.",
        "UX design manages user data collection and analytics, while UI design determines the mechanical layout of digital interface components.",
        "UX design represents the coding infrastructure of a digital product, while UI design handles aesthetic color schemes and typography selections."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The key distinction between UX and UI design lies in their scope and focus. UX design takes a holistic approach to understanding and improving the entire user experience, encompassing research, strategy, and user satisfaction. UI design, in contrast, concentrates on the specific visual and interactive elements that users directly engage with in a digital interface."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How do you define a good _user experience_?",
      "options": [
        "A good user experience is defined by a product's ability to effectively meet user needs, provide intuitive navigation, solve problems efficiently, and create a seamless, enjoyable interaction that exceeds user expectations.",
        "A good user experience relies primarily on aesthetic appeal and minimalist design principles, regardless of functional utility.",
        "A good user experience is determined by the speed of interaction and the number of features compressed into a single interface.",
        "A good user experience is measured solely by the complexity of a product's features and the technical sophistication of its design framework."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Defining a good user experience requires understanding that it goes beyond mere functionality. It involves creating an emotional connection with users by anticipating their needs, providing clear and intuitive interactions, and delivering value that feels both effortless and meaningful. Successful UX design balances user satisfaction, business goals, and technological capabilities."

      "id": 10,
      "question": "How important is _accessibility_ in _UX design_?",
      "options": [
        "Accessibility in UX design is crucial because it ensures digital products can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities, and prevents legal and reputational risks for organizations.",
        "Accessibility is an optional design consideration that adds unnecessary complexity and increases development costs without significant user benefits.",
        "Accessibility is primarily a technical requirement that only affects a small percentage of users and can be addressed through minimal design modifications.",
        "Accessibility is mainly about providing alternative color schemes and is not a fundamental aspect of creating inclusive digital experiences."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Accessibility goes beyond simple accommodations and is a fundamental design principle. It ensures digital products are usable by people with various disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

      "id": 12,
      "question": "Can you explain the concept of _User Personas_?",
      "options": [
        "User personas are purely statistical representations derived from quantitative data without considering individual user experiences.",
        "User personas are static, one-dimensional profiles created by management to represent an idealized version of their target audience.",
        "User personas are basic demographic summaries used primarily for marketing segmentation without meaningful insights for design.",
        "User personas are detailed, fictional character representations of target user groups that help designers understand user needs, behaviors, goals, and motivations during the design process."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "User personas transform abstract user research into relatable, human-centered profiles that guide design decisions. By capturing not just demographics but also psychological traits, challenges, and aspirations, personas help design teams empathize with users. They serve as a common reference point, ensuring product design remains focused on solving real user problems."
