        "Redis is an in-memory key-value data store designed for high performance and versatility, supporting complex data structures like strings, lists, sets, and hashes while providing optional disk persistence."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Redis stands out as an advanced in-memory data store that offers remarkable speed and flexibility. Unlike traditional databases, it stores data primarily in memory for rapid access, supports multiple data structures, and can optionally persist data to disk, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and high-performance scenarios."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "How does _Redis_ store data?",
      "options": [
        "Redis manages data storage using a hierarchical tree-based structure that maps complex relationships between different data points, prioritizing data integrity and referential consistency.",

        "The SET and GET commands in Redis represent high-level data manipulation interfaces that support complex object serialization and dynamic type conversion."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "SET and GET are foundational Redis commands for simple key-value operations. SET allows storing data at a specific key, while GET retrieves that data, providing a straightforward mechanism for basic data storage and retrieval in the Redis in-memory database."

      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Redis provides atomic increment operations that make counter implementation straightforward.

        "Redis Pub/Sub is a distributed messaging framework that requires explicit acknowledgment from subscribers and maintains message delivery guarantees through a complex routing mechanism."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The Redis Pub/Sub model allows message broadcasting without establishing direct connections between publishers and subscribers. Messages are distributed through channels, enabling loose coupling and flexible communication. Publishers send messages to channels without knowing who will receive them, and subscribers can listen to channels without being aware of the publishers."
