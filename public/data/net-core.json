      "question": "What is _.NET Core_ and how does it differ from the _.NET Framework_?",
      "options": [
        ".NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source development framework by Microsoft that supports building modern applications with high performance and flexibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.",
        ".NET Core represents a legacy framework primarily used for maintaining older Microsoft application infrastructures with minimal modern development capabilities.",
        ".NET Core is a specialized Windows-based runtime environment exclusively designed for enterprise-level web applications with limited cross-platform compatibility.",
        ".NET Core is a cloud-specific deployment framework that exclusively supports microservices architecture with restricted programming language support."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": ".NET Core represents a significant evolution in Microsoft's development ecosystem. It provides developers with a modular, lightweight framework that supports multiple programming languages like C#, F#, and Visual Basic. Unlike traditional .NET Framework, it offers true cross-platform development, enabling applications to run on different operating systems with minimal modifications. Its key strengths include high performance, built-in dependency injection, and support for containerization technologies like Docker."
    },
    {

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Cross-platform capabilities are fundamental to .NET Core's design. The framework achieves this through a runtime environment that abstracts platform-specific details, allowing the same codebase to execute across different operating systems. Developers can leverage shared libraries and APIs that work consistently regardless of the target platform. This approach reduces development overhead and enables more flexible, portable application architectures."
    },

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The directory structure in .NET Core helps maintain project organization and separation of concerns. It provides a consistent approach for developers to structure their projects, making code more readable and maintainable. The src directory typically contains the main application code, tests house different types of testing projects, and additional directories support build, documentation, and artifact management processes."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "How do you add and manage _NuGet packages_ in a _.NET Core project_?",
