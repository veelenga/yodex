    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is a _Tree Data Structure_?",
      "options": [
        "A tree data structure is a recursive computational model that represents mathematical relationships and hierarchical computations using node-based connectivity patterns.",
        "A tree data structure is a linear collection of interconnected nodes that can be traversed in multiple directions, representing complex network relationships between data elements.",
        "A tree data structure is a non-linear storage mechanism that allows random access and parallel processing of interconnected data points across multiple levels.",
        "A tree data structure is a hierarchical collection of nodes organized in a parent-child relationship, typically starting from a root node and branching out to other nodes with a clear hierarchical structure."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Trees are fundamental data structures that represent hierarchical relationships. Unlike linear data structures like arrays or linked lists, trees allow each node to have multiple child nodes. The hierarchical nature enables efficient organization, searching, and representation of complex relationships in various domains like file systems, organizational structures, and computational algorithms."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is a _Binary Tree_?",
      "options": [
        "A binary tree is a specialized tree structure where each node can have at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and right child, creating a hierarchical data organization with binary branching.",
        "A binary tree is a computational model where nodes are connected through bidirectional links, allowing multiple traversal paths and supporting complex data mapping techniques.",
        "A binary tree is a recursive data structure that represents mathematical relationships using two-way node connections and symmetric branching patterns.",
        "A binary tree is a hierarchical representation that enables parallel processing of data elements through balanced, symmetrical node distributions."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Binary trees are specialized tree structures with strict node connectivity rules. Each node can have zero, one, or two children, but never more than two. This constraint makes binary trees particularly useful for efficient searching, sorting, and hierarchical data representation in computer science and algorithmic implementations."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Explain _Height_ and _Depths_ in the context of a _Tree_.",
      "options": [
        "Height and depth represent the total number of nodes in vertical and horizontal traversals, providing a comprehensive measure of tree complexity.",
        "Height and depth are recursive mathematical properties that quantify the structural complexity and connectivity of nodes in tree-based data representations.",
        "Height and depth in tree structures are interchangeable metrics that measure the vertical distance between nodes using different computational algorithms.",
        "In tree structures, height represents the number of edges in the longest path from a node to a leaf, while depth measures the number of edges from the root node to a specific node."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Height and depth are fundamental measurements in tree structures that help understand the tree's geometry and complexity. Height focuses on the longest path from a node downward, while depth measures the distance from the root. These metrics are crucial for analyzing tree balance, performance, and computational efficiency in various algorithmic contexts."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the difference between a _Tree_ and a _Graph_?",
      "options": [
        "A tree is a type of graph with additional constraints on node connectivity, characterized by its ability to represent hierarchical relationships through branching structures.",
        "A tree is a directional network of nodes that allows bidirectional connections, whereas a graph is a more rigid and structured representation of node relationships.",

        "Trees and graphs are fundamentally identical data structures, with the primary difference being the labeling convention used in computational modeling and representation."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The key distinction between trees and graphs lies in their structural properties. Trees have a strict hierarchical organization with a single root, no cycles, and each node (except the root) having exactly one parent. Graphs are more flexible, allowing multiple connections between nodes, potential cycles, and no mandatory hierarchical structure."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Define _Leaf_ and _Internal_ nodes in a _Tree_.",

        "Leaf nodes are intermediate nodes with partial connections, while internal nodes represent the primary structural elements of a tree's topology."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "In tree data structures, leaf nodes are the endpoints without any descendant nodes, typically found at the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes, conversely, are intermediate nodes that have one or more child nodes and play a crucial role in maintaining the tree's hierarchical structure and connectivity."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is a _Rooted Tree_, and how does it differ from an _Unrooted Tree_?",
      "options": [
        "Rooted trees have strict hierarchical constraints, and unrooted trees provide more flexible node interaction and relationship modeling.",
        "Rooted trees are static structures with predetermined node relationships, whereas unrooted trees allow dynamic reconfiguration of node connections.",
        "A rooted tree represents a linear progression of nodes, while an unrooted tree enables multiple potential traversal paths without a central reference point.",
        "A rooted tree has a designated starting point (root) from which all nodes are reachable, while an unrooted tree lacks a specific starting node and can be viewed from multiple perspectives."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The primary difference between rooted and unrooted trees is the presence or absence of a central reference node. Rooted trees have a clear top-down orientation with a single root, making hierarchical relationships explicit. Unrooted trees lack this structured approach, allowing multiple potential interpretations of node relationships."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,

        "An N-ary Tree is a recursive data structure that allows nodes to have a predefined, static number of child branches in a symmetrical configuration."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "An N-ary Tree fundamentally differs from binary trees by permitting nodes to have more than two children. This flexibility enables more complex hierarchical representations, useful in scenarios like file systems, organizational structures, and parsing expressions where nodes naturally require multiple child relationships."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The Full Binary Tree's distinctive characteristic is its strict two-child rule: every internal node must have exactly two children, while leaf nodes have none. This creates a highly structured and predictable tree configuration, essential in certain algorithmic and computational modeling scenarios."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What is the significance of the _degree of a node_ in a tree?",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Node degree is a fundamental tree metric that quantifies a node's direct connections. It helps understand structural complexity, with leaf nodes having zero degree and internal nodes potentially having multiple children. This concept is crucial in analyzing tree traversal, balanced tree properties, and computational complexity."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Explain the concept of a _Path_ in a tree.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A path represents the connection between nodes in a tree, showing how nodes are linked. It can be a route from the root to a specific node or between any two nodes. The path's significance lies in understanding node relationships, traversal routes, and structural connections within the tree."
