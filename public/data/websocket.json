    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is WebSocket protocol and how does it differ from HTTP?",
      "options": [
        "WebSocket is a full-duplex communication protocol that enables bidirectional, persistent connections between clients and servers, allowing real-time data exchange over a single TCP connection.",
        "WebSocket represents a secure communication layer that encrypts data packets and manages network routing between distributed computing systems.",
        "WebSocket is a unidirectional network protocol that establishes temporary connections between web browsers and servers, primarily used for static data transmission.",
        "WebSocket is an extension of HTTP that creates multiple parallel connection streams to optimize data transfer between web applications and backend services."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "WebSocket differs fundamentally from HTTP by maintaining a persistent, open connection that allows instant, two-way communication. Unlike traditional HTTP requests which are stateless and require repeated connection establishments, WebSocket enables continuous, low-latency data exchange with minimal overhead, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat systems, live updates, and collaborative platforms."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Explain how the WebSocket handshake works.",
      "options": [
        "The WebSocket handshake is an HTTP-based negotiation where the client sends an upgrade request to transform a standard HTTP connection into a WebSocket connection, using specific headers to establish a persistent communication channel.",
        "WebSocket handshake is a network-level protocol that validates client credentials and establishes a temporary encrypted communication tunnel between endpoints.",
        "The handshake process creates a distributed connection management system that dynamically allocates network resources and validates client-server compatibility.",
        "The WebSocket handshake involves a complex authentication mechanism where clients must provide multiple cryptographic tokens to initiate a secure connection with the server."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The WebSocket handshake transforms a standard HTTP connection by using specific upgrade headers, allowing the protocol to transition from a request-response model to a persistent, full-duplex communication channel. This process enables real-time, bidirectional data exchange with minimal network overhead and reduced latency."

      "options": [
        "The HTML5 WebSocket API provides unidirectional communication channels using HTTP polling mechanisms with limited connection stability and increased server load.",
        "The HTML5 WebSocket API facilitates communication through temporary socket connections that automatically terminate after each data exchange, ensuring minimal resource consumption.",
        "The HTML5 WebSocket API enables full-duplex, low-latency communication through a persistent connection, using a standard HTTP/HTTPS handshake to upgrade the protocol and establish bidirectional real-time data exchange.",
        "WebSocket API in HTML5 represents a stateless communication protocol that requires continuous re-authentication and manual connection management for each data transmission."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "WebSocket API represents a significant advancement in web communication, allowing persistent, real-time connections between clients and servers. The protocol upgrades from standard HTTP, enabling efficient, bidirectional communication with reduced overhead compared to traditional polling methods."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,

    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "How do WebSockets handle communication through proxies and firewalls?",
      "options": [
        "WebSockets handle proxy and firewall challenges by initially establishing a standard HTTP connection and then upgrading to a WebSocket connection, which helps bypass traditional network restrictions.",
        "Proxies and firewalls automatically detect WebSocket connections and create dedicated passthrough routes based on the connection's unique WebSocket headers.",
        "WebSockets bypass proxies by using a special encrypted protocol that tunnels through standard network infrastructure without requiring any initial handshake.",
        "WebSocket connections are automatically recognized by all proxy servers and firewalls due to their standardized communication mechanism inherent in the WebSocket specification."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "WebSocket connections must start as HTTP requests to be compatible with existing network infrastructure. The WebSocket protocol includes an upgrade mechanism where the initial HTTP connection is transformed into a full-duplex WebSocket connection. This approach allows WebSockets to work through many existing proxy servers and firewalls by mimicking standard HTTP communication before establishing a persistent connection."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What are the security considerations when using WebSockets?",
      "options": [
        "WebSocket connections are automatically encrypted and secured by default, requiring no additional security measures beyond the standard connection establishment process.",
        "WebSocket security is inherently managed by browser implementations, which automatically filter and protect against all potential cross-origin and injection attacks without additional configuration.",
        "Security for WebSockets is primarily achieved through client-side validation techniques that prevent unauthorized data transmission before it reaches the server infrastructure.",
        "WebSocket security requires implementing strict cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies, validating and sanitizing all incoming data, and using secure WebSocket protocols (wss://) to prevent potential vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "WebSocket security is a critical concern that requires proactive implementation. Developers must manually configure security measures like CORS policies, input validation, and secure protocols. Browser implementations do not automatically provide comprehensive protection, so explicit security strategies are necessary to prevent potential attacks like cross-site scripting, data injection, and unauthorized access."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "How would you detect and handle WebSocket connection loss?",
      "options": [
        "Connection loss in WebSockets is automatically managed by browser implementations, which seamlessly reconnect without requiring any additional developer intervention.",
        "WebSocket connection loss can be detected through periodic heartbeat mechanisms, implementing automatic reconnection strategies, and monitoring connection state changes on both client and server sides.",
        "WebSocket connections maintain persistent state through built-in network resilience protocols that prevent disconnection and automatically restore communication channels.",
        "Detecting WebSocket connection loss involves using static timeout configurations that trigger reconnection attempts based on predefined network performance metrics."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Handling WebSocket connection loss requires active monitoring and implementation of reconnection strategies. Developers must manually create heartbeat mechanisms, track connection states, and implement custom reconnection logic. There are no universal, automatic solutions for managing WebSocket disconnections across different platforms and network environments."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Explain the role of ping/pong frames in WebSockets.",
      "options": [
        "Ping and Pong frames are encryption mechanisms used to secure WebSocket communication channels and prevent unauthorized data transmission between clients and servers.",

        "Ping and Pong frames in WebSockets are network-level control frames used to maintain the connection, check network latency, and verify that the WebSocket connection remains active and responsive."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "WebSocket connections require periodic health checks to ensure continuous communication. Ping frames are sent by one endpoint, which expects a corresponding Pong frame in response. This mechanism helps detect connection interruptions, measure round-trip latency, and keep the connection alive, especially through network intermediaries that might otherwise close idle connections."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "How does WebSocket ensure ordered delivery of messages?",
      "options": [
        "WebSocket maintains message order through a specialized buffering mechanism that tracks and resequences network packets before final transmission.",
        "WebSocket preserves message ordering by using a parallel processing algorithm that synchronizes concurrent data streams dynamically.",
        "WebSocket ensures message order by implementing a client-side message queue that reconstructs messages based on timestamp metadata before rendering.",
        "WebSocket ensures ordered message delivery through its inherent protocol design, which maintains message sequence and prevents out-of-order packet transmission during full-duplex communication."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The WebSocket protocol fundamentally preserves message order by treating the communication channel as a single, sequential data stream. Each message is transmitted in the exact sequence it was sent, which prevents potential reordering issues common in other network protocols. This design ensures that messages arrive exactly as they were originally dispatched, maintaining data integrity and predictable communication."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Can WebSockets be used for broadcasting messages to multiple clients? If so, how?",
      "options": [
        "WebSockets support broadcasting by implementing a publish-subscribe model where clients autonomously register and receive messages based on predefined topic subscriptions.",
        "WebSockets can broadcast messages to multiple clients by maintaining a collection of active connections and using server-side logic to iterate and send messages to all connected clients simultaneously.",
        "WebSockets broadcast messages by creating separate communication channels for each client group, allowing targeted multi-client transmission through network segmentation.",
        "WebSockets enable broadcasting through a centralized message routing system that dynamically allocates message distribution priorities across connected endpoints."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Broadcasting in WebSockets typically involves maintaining a registry of active client connections on the server. When a broadcast message needs to be sent, the server iterates through its connection list and transmits the message to each connected client. While the core WebSocket protocol doesn't natively implement broadcasting, server-side implementations can easily create this functionality by managing connection pools and implementing custom message distribution logic."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What is the difference between WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE)?",
      "options": [
        "SSE provides full bidirectional communication similar to WebSockets, supporting both client-to-server and server-to-client message exchanges through advanced HTTP streaming techniques.",
        "WebSockets and SSE are identical communication protocols that enable real-time data transmission with no fundamental differences in their communication model.",
        "WebSockets are a deprecated technology replaced by Server-Sent Events, which offer more comprehensive and modern real-time communication capabilities for web applications.",
        "WebSockets are bidirectional and full-duplex, allowing real-time two-way communication between client and server, while Server-Sent Events (SSE) only support one-way server-to-client communication using standard HTTP connections."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The key distinction is communication direction: WebSockets support two-way, simultaneous communication using a dedicated WebSocket protocol, while SSE is limited to server-to-client messages using standard HTTP connections. WebSockets require more complex setup but offer more flexibility, whereas SSE is simpler and works seamlessly with existing HTTP infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Explain how a WebSocket connection is closed.",
      "options": [
        "WebSocket connections remain permanently open and can only be terminated by physically disconnecting network hardware or restarting the application.",
        "Closing a WebSocket connection requires renegotiating the entire connection handshake and cannot be performed through a standard close method.",
        "WebSocket connections automatically terminate after a fixed timeout period, with no explicit mechanism for controlled closure by either client or server.",
        "A WebSocket connection can be closed by either the client or server explicitly using the close() method, which triggers a CloseEvent with a status code and optional reason message."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "WebSocket connections provide a clean, standardized mechanism for graceful termination. The close() method allows controlled shutdown, generating a CloseEvent that provides details about the connection termination. This enables proper resource management and allows applications to handle connection closures elegantly."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What fallback mechanisms can be used if WebSockets are not supported by a browser or server?",
      "options": [
        "When WebSockets fail, applications must completely disable real-time communication and revert to traditional request-response HTTP interactions.",
        "The primary fallback for WebSocket incompatibility is implementing custom proprietary protocols that simulate real-time communication through complex client-side techniques.",
        "Browser-specific JavaScript polyfills can directly replace WebSocket functionality by emulating the entire WebSocket connection lifecycle without alternative protocols.",
        "WebSocket fallback mechanisms include long polling, HTTP streaming, and using libraries like Socket.IO that automatically negotiate alternative connection strategies when WebSockets are unavailable."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Fallback mechanisms ensure continuous real-time communication across different browser and server environments. These strategies dynamically adapt to network and compatibility constraints, providing resilient communication methods that progressively enhance connection capabilities based on client support."
