      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The SELECT statement is crucial for data retrieval in SQL databases. It allows users to extract specific columns from tables, apply filtering conditions, and organize results. Unlike data modification commands, SELECT is primarily a read-only operation that does not alter the underlying table data. It supports various clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to provide flexible data querying capabilities."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the difference between _WHERE_ and _HAVING_ clauses?",
      "options": [
        "The WHERE clause is exclusively used in JOIN operations to match related records, whereas the HAVING clause manages data type conversions during query execution.",
        "The WHERE clause filters individual records before grouping, applying conditions to raw data columns, while the HAVING clause filters grouped results after aggregation has been performed.",
        "The WHERE clause operates on aggregated data sets, filtering results after complex computations, while the HAVING clause performs initial row-level filtering before any data processing.",
        "The WHERE clause handles complex mathematical transformations on column values, and the HAVING clause manages database-wide filtering across multiple table relationships."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "WHERE and HAVING clauses serve different filtering purposes in SQL queries. The WHERE clause is applied before grouping and aggregation, working directly on individual rows. HAVING is used after GROUP BY operations, allowing conditions to be applied to aggregated results. This fundamental difference determines when and how filtering occurs in a SQL query."

        "A primary key is a database index that speeds up query performance by creating a reference point for faster data retrieval and search operations."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Primary keys are crucial for maintaining data integrity by providing a unique way to identify each record in a table. They must be unique, non-null, and typically remain unchanged throughout the record's lifecycle. By ensuring each row has a distinct identifier, primary keys prevent data redundancy and support relationships between different database tables."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Explain what a _foreign key_ is and how it is used.",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Foreign keys are essential for creating and maintaining relationships between database tables. They ensure that data remains consistent across related tables by preventing orphaned records and enforcing referential integrity. When a foreign key is defined, it guarantees that any value in the referencing column must exist in the referenced table's primary key column."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "How can you prevent _SQL injections_?",
      "options": [
        "Blocking SQL injections can be achieved by implementing real-time monitoring systems that detect and automatically reject suspicious database query patterns.",
        "SQL injection prevention requires creating dynamic query structures that automatically filter and sanitize incoming user input before database processing.",
        "Preventing SQL injections involves using complex encryption algorithms and implementing multi-layer security protocols to shield database queries from external manipulation attempts.",
        "To prevent SQL injections, developers should use parameterized queries and implement strict input validation to separate user-provided data from SQL commands and block malicious script insertions."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "SQL injection is a serious security vulnerability where attackers attempt to manipulate database queries by inserting malicious code. Parameterized queries are the most effective defense, as they treat user input as data rather than executable code. By using prepared statements and carefully validating all input, developers can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized database access and potential data breaches."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is _normalization_? Explain with examples.",

        "Normalization is an advanced database optimization technique that consolidates data relationships by merging similar columns and reducing overall table complexity.",
        "Normalization is a database design technique that organizes data to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing larger tables into smaller, more focused tables with clear relationships.",
        "Normalization represents a method of data compression where redundant information is strategically repeated across multiple tables to improve database retrieval speed.",
        "Normalization is a process of combining multiple database tables to create more complex data structures with increased storage efficiency and simplified query mechanisms."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The goal of normalization is to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity by organizing data into logical, efficiently structured tables. By breaking down larger tables into smaller, more specialized ones, database designers can minimize data duplication, ensure data consistency, and simplify data maintenance. The process typically involves creating separate tables for related data and establishing clear relationships between them using primary and foreign keys."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,

        "Denormalization is a data restructuring method that eliminates unnecessary relationships between database tables to create more streamlined and compact data models."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Denormalization deliberately breaks traditional normalization rules to enhance database query performance. By strategically duplicating data or pre-aggregating information, database designers can reduce the computational complexity of retrieving information. This approach trades some data redundancy for faster read operations, making it particularly useful in read-heavy systems like data warehouses and reporting databases."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What are _indexes_ and how can they improve query performance?",
      "options": [
        "Indexes are specialized database algorithms that automatically reorganize data to optimize storage efficiency and reduce overall memory consumption.",
        "Indexes are database structures that improve query performance by creating a quick lookup mechanism that allows faster data retrieval without scanning entire tables.",

        "Indexes represent a data management technique for dynamically sorting and categorizing database entries to enhance real-time data processing capabilities."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Database indexes function similarly to a book's table of contents, providing a rapid way to locate specific data without scanning every row. By creating a separate data structure that references the original table's location, indexes dramatically reduce query execution time. They are particularly effective for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and sorting operations."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of the _GROUP BY_ clause.",
      "options": [
        "The GROUP BY clause serves as a data filtering mechanism that reduces query complexity by automatically removing duplicate entries from result sets.",
        "The GROUP BY clause allows direct manipulation of row relationships by creating dynamic connection points between different database tables and their respective columns.",

      "id": 14,
      "question": "What is a _subquery_, and when would you use one?",
      "options": [
        "A subquery represents a temporary database object that dynamically generates intermediate result sets for complex transaction management and data routing.",
        "A subquery functions as a specialized data transformation technique that restructures relational data by creating temporary computational pathways between different database tables.",
        "A subquery is an advanced SQL mechanism designed to create parallel processing paths that optimize database query performance and memory allocation.",
        "A subquery is a nested SQL query embedded within another query, typically used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query's filtering, comparison, or computational processes."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Subqueries provide a powerful method for performing complex database operations by allowing one query to be nested inside another. They enable more sophisticated data retrieval and filtering strategies that go beyond simple direct selections, supporting intricate logical conditions and nested data comparisons."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Describe the functions of the _ORDER BY_ clause.",
      "options": [
