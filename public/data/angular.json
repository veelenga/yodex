        "Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework developed by Google for building dynamic single-page applications with robust component-based architecture and powerful features.",
        "Angular is a modular framework for developing cross-platform mobile and web applications, focusing on dependency injection and real-time data synchronization.",
        "Angular is a client-side JavaScript library primarily used for creating interactive user interfaces with a focus on reactive programming and virtual DOM manipulation."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Angular is a powerful front-end framework that provides developers with a structured approach to building web applications. It offers a component-based architecture where each component manages its own template, logic, and styling. The framework leverages TypeScript, which adds strong typing and object-oriented programming features to JavaScript. Key advantages include two-way data binding, dependency injection, and comprehensive tooling support through Angular CLI.\n\nExample of a basic Angular component:\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-example',\n  template: '<h1>{{title}}</h1>'\n})\nexport class ExampleComponent {\n  title = 'My Angular App';\n}\n```"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Explain _data-binding_ in Angular. What are the different types?",
      "options": [
        "Data binding is a one-way communication method in Angular that exclusively transfers data from backend services to front-end components without two-way interaction.",
        "Data binding represents the process of manually mapping component properties to DOM elements through complex configuration and explicit transformation rules.",

        "Components are backend service connectors that manage data flow, and directives are responsible for creating visual representations of application data.",
        "Components represent static view containers without logic, while directives are dynamic event-handling mechanisms that control application state and user interactions."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Components and directives serve different purposes in Angular's architecture. Components are comprehensive units with their own template, logic, and styling, acting as the primary building blocks of an application. Directives, by contrast, are more focused on modifying element behavior. A typical component might look like: ```typescript @Component({ selector: 'app-example', template: '<div>Hello World</div>' }) ```"

      "id": 13,
      "question": "How do you handle _form submissions_ in Angular?",
      "options": [
        "Angular supports form submissions only through manual event binding and custom validation implemented directly in component classes.",
        "Angular form submissions can be handled using either Template-Driven Forms or Reactive Forms, with Reactive Forms providing more advanced features and flexibility for complex form interactions.",
        "Form submissions in Angular are exclusively managed through HttpClient, which captures form data and sends it to the server using predefined HTTP methods.",
        "Form submissions are handled by converting form data into observable streams and processing them through RxJS operators in the component."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Angular provides two primary approaches to form handling. Template-Driven Forms are simpler and use two-way data binding, while Reactive Forms offer more programmatic control and are better suited for complex validation scenarios. To use forms effectively, developers must import either FormsModule or ReactiveFormsModule and configure form controls appropriately. \n\nExample of a basic Reactive Form setup:\n```typescript\nthis.myForm = this.formBuilder.group({\n  username: ['', Validators.required],\n  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]]\n});\n```"
