    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Explain the _virtual DOM_ in _Vue.js_.",
      "options": [
        "The Virtual DOM in Vue.js is a static mapping of component structures that requires manual reconciliation between component states.",
        "The Virtual DOM in Vue.js is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM that allows efficient updates by comparing changes and minimizing direct DOM manipulation.",
        "The Virtual DOM in Vue.js is a memory-intensive rendering technique that creates a complete copy of the DOM for each component update.",
        "The Virtual DOM in Vue.js is a complete replacement for the actual DOM that renders every component independently without any optimization strategies."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual Document Object Model. It enables Vue.js to perform efficient updates by comparing the current and previous DOM states and applying only the necessary changes. This approach significantly reduces performance overhead and creates a more responsive user interface. Here's a simple example of how Virtual DOM works:"

        "Vue.js directives are CSS-like selectors that define static styling rules for component rendering and element positioning."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Directives are powerful Vue.js extensions that allow developers to extend HTML with dynamic behaviors. They provide a declarative way to connect component data with DOM elements and enable complex interactions. Directives can modify element attributes, handle events, conditionally render content, and manage component lifecycle."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "How do you handle user _inputs_ and _form submissions_ in _Vue.js_?",
      "options": [
        "In Vue.js, form inputs are managed exclusively through event listeners that manually track and update component states.",

        "In Vue.js, form submissions require explicit DOM manipulation methods to transfer input values between template and component logic.",
        "In Vue.js, form inputs and submissions are handled through two-way data binding using the v-model directive, which synchronizes input values with component data properties."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Vue.js provides an elegant solution for form handling through reactive two-way data binding. The v-model directive automatically synchronizes input values with component data, eliminating the need for manual event tracking and state updates. This approach simplifies form management and ensures consistent data flow."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Discuss the _methods_ property in a _Vue component_.",
      "options": [
        "Methods in Vue are lifecycle hooks that automatically trigger at specific component rendering stages, managing the internal state transformation process.",

        "The methods property in a Vue component defines custom methods that can interact with component data and handle events, improving code organization and reusability.",
        "The methods property is a reactive data container that synchronizes component state with external data sources and manages complex state management scenarios."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Methods in Vue components are functions defined within the methods object that can be called from templates or used as event handlers. They have direct access to the component's data and can modify the component's state. Methods are always bound to the component instance, ensuring they can access this context.\n\nExample of method definition:\n```javascript\nmethods: {\n  incrementCounter() {\n    this.count++;\n  },\n  handleClick(event) {\n    // Method with event parameter\n  }\n}\n```"
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Explain the difference between `v-bind` and `v-model`.",
      "options": [
        "V-bind is a one-way data binding directive that connects a component's data to an element's attribute, while v-model creates two-way binding between form inputs and component data.",
        "The v-model directive is a unidirectional data flow mechanism that strictly controls data mutation through predefined component methods.",
        "V-bind is primarily used for event handling in Vue components, whereas v-model manages complex data transformation between different component layers.",
        "V-bind and v-model are interchangeable directives that handle data synchronization between template elements and component state with identical binding mechanisms."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "V-bind and v-model serve different data binding purposes in Vue. V-bind dynamically updates element attributes, while v-model creates automatic two-way data synchronization, particularly useful with form inputs.\n\nExample demonstrating the difference:\n```html\n<!-- V-bind example -->\n<img v-bind:src=\"imageUrl\">\n\n<!-- V-model example -->\n<input v-model=\"username\">\n```"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What are _computed properties_ and how are they used?",
      "options": [
        "Computed properties create isolated data streams that transform component state through predefined mutation strategies and dependency tracking.",
        "Computed properties are event-driven methods that trigger recalculations on specific component lifecycle stages, managing complex state transformations.",
        "Computed properties are reactive functions that derive values based on other data properties, automatically updating when dependencies change and providing cached, efficient calculations.",
        "Computed properties are static functions that precompute data values during component initialization, optimizing rendering performance through memoization."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Computed properties offer a powerful way to create derived values that automatically update when their dependencies change. They are cached and only re-evaluate when needed, providing performance benefits over methods.\n\nExample of computed property usage:\n```javascript\ncomputed: {\n  fullName() {\n    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n  },\n  isAdult() {\n    return this.age >= 18;\n  }\n}\n```"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Can you discuss the difference between _computed properties_ and _methods_?",
      "options": [
        "Computed properties are dynamic functions that execute every time they are called, while methods are static data properties that cache their initial calculation. Methods are more efficient for complex data transformations.",
        "Computed properties are cached data derived from other data based on specific logic, while methods are functions called on demand. Computed properties only re-evaluate when their dependent data changes, offering better performance for complex calculations.",
        "Computed properties are event-driven reactive calculations that update in real-time, whereas methods are manually triggered functions that require explicit invocation in the template or script.",
        "Computed properties and methods are essentially the same, both being ways to define reusable logic within a Vue component. They can be used interchangeably without any significant performance differences."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "In Vue.js, computed properties leverage caching to optimize performance. They only recalculate when their dependent data changes, making them more efficient than methods for repeated calculations. Methods, by contrast, are executed every time they are called, regardless of whether the underlying data has changed. This makes computed properties ideal for derived data that doesn't need constant recalculation. A typical example demonstrates the difference in usage and performance."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What are _watchers_ in _Vue.js_?",
      "options": [
        "Watchers are advanced data binding mechanisms that create two-way reactive connections between different component properties, ensuring immediate synchronization of related data.",
        "Watchers are background processes in Vue.js that continuously monitor all component data and generate performance metrics. They help developers understand data flow and component interactions.",
        "Watchers in Vue.js are reactive methods that observe specific data properties and trigger custom logic when those properties change. They provide a way to respond to data mutations and perform side effects or complex operations.",
        "Watchers are event listeners that monitor template changes and automatically update the component's data model. They are primarily used for synchronizing UI state with data properties."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Vue watchers provide a powerful mechanism for reacting to data changes. They can perform complex asynchronous operations, validate data, or trigger subsequent state updates. Watchers are defined in the 'watch' option and can be configured with various options like deep watching or immediate execution. A typical watcher might look like this: ```javascript watch: { searchQuery(newValue, oldValue) { this.fetchResults(newValue); } }```"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "How do you _bind inline styles_ in a _Vue template_?",
      "options": [
        "Inline styles in Vue are managed through a centralized style management system that requires pre-registering all possible style variations before they can be applied to components.",
        "Inline styles in Vue are applied using traditional HTML style attributes, with Vue providing no special mechanism for dynamic styling. Developers must manually update styles using JavaScript.",
        "Vue's inline style binding works exclusively through CSS classes, requiring developers to define complex class mappings to achieve dynamic styling effects.",
        "Inline styles in Vue can be bound using the `:style` directive, which accepts an object where keys represent CSS properties and values represent their corresponding values. This allows dynamic and reactive styling directly in the template."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Vue's style binding provides a flexible and intuitive way to apply dynamic styles. The `:style` directive can accept objects, arrays, or even computed properties, making styling highly dynamic and reactive. Example of style binding: ```vue <div :style=\"{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }\">Dynamic Style</div>```"
