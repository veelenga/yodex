        "DROP, DELETE, and TRUNCATE represent transaction control mechanisms that manage data consistency and ensure reliable database state preservation during complex operations.",
        "DROP, DELETE, and TRUNCATE are SQL commands with distinct behaviors: DROP permanently removes a table structure, DELETE removes specific rows with transaction logging, and TRUNCATE quickly removes all rows without detailed logging.",
        "DROP, DELETE, and TRUNCATE are SQL operations designed to manage memory allocation, helping databases efficiently manage storage resources and prevent memory fragmentation.",
        "DROP, DELETE, and TRUNCATE are database maintenance commands used for restructuring data storage, with each targeting different levels of data management and system optimization."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "These SQL commands serve different purposes in database management. DROP is the most destructive, completely removing a table and its structure. DELETE allows selective row removal and maintains transaction logs, making it reversible. TRUNCATE is the fastest method for removing all rows, resetting the table's storage, but it cannot be easily rolled back and lacks the granular control of DELETE."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between a _full join_ and an _inner join_?",
      "options": [
        "A full join returns all records from both tables, matching where possible and filling unmatched rows with NULL values, while an inner join only returns records with matching values in both tables.",
        "Full joins and inner joins represent identical database joining techniques, primarily distinguished by their optional NULL handling and record selection strategies.",
        "A full join combines only matching records from both tables with exact column matches, whereas an inner join allows partial record retrieval based on condition complexity.",
        "An inner join returns complete record sets with comprehensive data overlap, while a full join provides a limited subset of records based on predefined join conditions."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Full joins are comprehensive join operations that preserve all records from both tables, regardless of match status. They ensure no data is lost during the join process by adding NULL values for unmatched records. Inner joins, conversely, are selective, returning only records with precise matches across specified columns, effectively filtering out non-matching data."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "How would you write an _SQL query_ to fetch duplicate records from a table?",
      "options": [
        "Duplicate records can be detected by implementing complex window functions that track row frequency across multiple table partitions.",

        "Identifying duplicate entries requires creating temporary tables that aggregate and compare record occurrences using recursive query techniques.",
        "Detecting duplicate records involves using subquery methods that cross-reference table data against predefined uniqueness constraints."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Identifying duplicate records is a common database task that involves analyzing row frequency. The standard approach uses GROUP BY to cluster identical records and HAVING to filter those appearing more than once. This method efficiently identifies duplicates by counting occurrences of specific column combinations, allowing database administrators to recognize and potentially remove redundant entries."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is a _prepared statement_, and why would you use one?",

        "Prepared statements provide a sophisticated method of parameterizing database interactions through complex metadata mapping and query transformation strategies."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Prepared statements are a crucial database security and performance technique. By separating the SQL command structure from actual data values, they prevent malicious input from altering query intent. The precompilation process allows databases to parse and optimize queries in advance, reducing overhead during repeated executions and providing a robust defense against potential SQL injection vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What is the _N+1 query problem_ and how can you solve it?",
      "options": [
        "The N+1 query problem emerges when database transactions generate redundant query execution paths that create parallel processing overhead and increase computational complexity.",
        "The N+1 query problem represents a synchronization issue where database queries fail to efficiently cache intermediate result sets during large-scale data retrieval processes.",
        "The N+1 query problem occurs when database queries repeatedly fetch related entities in a loop, causing unnecessary and inefficient database roundtrips, typically happening in object-relational mapping scenarios.",
        "The N+1 query problem is a performance bottleneck caused by complex join operations that require multiple nested database connections and excessive memory allocation."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "This problem fundamentally stems from inefficient data retrieval strategies where instead of fetching related data in a single query, multiple separate queries are executed. To resolve this, techniques like eager loading, batch loading, or using appropriate JOIN operations can minimize unnecessary database hits and improve overall query performance."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Explain the function of _GROUP BY_ and _HAVING_ clauses in SQL.",
      "options": [
        "GROUP BY isolates specific database rows for individual processing, while HAVING manages transaction-level data partitioning across distributed database systems.",
        "GROUP BY creates temporary data structures for parallel query execution, and HAVING manages inter-group relationship constraints during database operations.",
        "GROUP BY generates intermediate result sets for complex mathematical computations, while HAVING validates data consistency across multiple database columns.",
        "GROUP BY groups rows with identical column values and allows aggregate functions like SUM or COUNT to be applied to those grouped sets, while HAVING filters those grouped results based on aggregate conditions."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "These SQL clauses are critical for data aggregation and filtering. GROUP BY enables breaking large datasets into meaningful subsets, allowing statistical analysis, while HAVING provides a way to filter those aggregated results based on computed values, offering more sophisticated querying capabilities."
