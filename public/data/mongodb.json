      "options": [
        "MongoDB is a graph database platform that specializes in managing interconnected data relationships using node and edge representations.",
        "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexible data modeling through JSON-like documents stored in collections.",
        "MongoDB is an in-memory key-value store designed for caching and real-time data processing with limited support for complex data structures.",
        "MongoDB is a traditional relational database management system that uses strict table structures and supports complex SQL queries for enterprise data storage."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "MongoDB distinguishes itself as a NoSQL database by offering a flexible document model that allows dynamic schemas and supports complex, nested data structures. Unlike traditional relational databases, it stores data in BSON format, enabling developers to work with more agile and adaptable data representations."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "How does _MongoDB_ differ from relational databases?",
      "options": [
        "MongoDB replaces relational databases by implementing a columnar storage model that requires extensive data preprocessing and transformation.",
        "MongoDB fundamentally operates like a traditional relational database, with mandatory foreign key constraints and fully normalized data structures.",
        "MongoDB is essentially identical to relational databases, using standard SQL queries and maintaining rigid table schemas with strict normalization rules.",
        "MongoDB differs from relational databases by using a flexible, document-based data model that allows dynamic schemas and does not require predefined table structures or complex join operations."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The key distinction is MongoDB's schema-less approach, which allows for more flexible data representation compared to rigid relational database structures. Documents can have varying fields and nested information, making it easier to adapt to changing application requirements without complex schema migrations."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Can you describe the structure of data in _MongoDB_?",
      "options": [
        "In MongoDB, data is structured as collections containing documents, which are JSON-like BSON objects that can represent complex, nested data with dynamic field definitions.",
        "MongoDB stores data as flat, single-level key-value pairs with no support for nested or complex data structures.",
        "MongoDB uses a fixed-schema approach where each document must conform to a precise, predefined data template across all entries.",
        "In MongoDB, data is organized strictly into tables with predefined columns, similar to traditional relational database management systems."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "MongoDB's data structure provides remarkable flexibility by allowing documents within a collection to have different fields and structures. The BSON format supports rich data types and enables developers to represent complex, hierarchical information without the constraints of traditional table-based databases."
